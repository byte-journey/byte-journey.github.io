                    <h3>Welcome</h3>
                    <p>
                        Step into the captivating world of technology and creativity with me, 
                        Gideon Gakpetor. Embark on a journey where innovation meets passion,

                    </p>
                    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm Gideon Gakpetor, a dynamic and driven IT professional with a boundless 
                        appetite for learning and creating. Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Information
                        Technology from Heritage Christian College Accra, my journey began in the quaint 
                        town of Sogakope, nestled in the heart of the Volta Region of Ghana.<br/>
                    </p>
                    <h3>What Do I Do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        From crafting sleek and responsive web interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                        to delving into the realms of Python, Java, Kotlin, and C++, my expertise spans 
                        across a diverse spectrum of programming languages and frameworks. But my passion 
                        doesn't stop there. I also immerse myself in the art of media, mastering the 
                        intricacies of photography and videography, and honing my skills with tools like 
                        Photoshop, Lightroom, Davinci Resolve, Canva, and Premiere Pro.<br/>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why Am I Here?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm on an exhilarating journey of personal projects, from building a 
                        cutting-edge mobile app in Kotlin with Google Cloud services as its backbone, to 
                        crafting a seamless desktop experience with Electron. My intermediate proficiency 
                        in IoT devices and programming, utilizing Arduino and Raspberry Pi, adds another 
                        dimension to my ever-expanding repertoire.<br/>
