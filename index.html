            <h5 style="line-height: 200%;">I am an astute and a performance-driven web and mobile developer from Ghana, with moderate experience<br/> and knowledge
                in Information Technology and work. I am passionate about science and technology and <br/>always hoping to extend my 
                understanding to helping humanity. I am ready to learn, apply and give attention <br/>to detail, time management, 
                technology and problem-solving skills to solve real world problems.
            </h5>
            <p>Having a clear understanding of anything is one key thing I learnt that leads to success. People, fields of study, technology.<br/>
                As a calm, reserved and hardworking person, clearly understanding anything is what I love to do. I hold a bachelor's degree <br/> in 
                Information Technology and I have average knowledge and skills to make a change in the field of work. I am a tech fanatic <br/>and always 
                glad to come across and learn any new things especially relating to IT. And I like helping others accomplish different <br/>tasks using 
                my skills. I want to contribute to making the world a better place and helping most understand.

            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <h5>There is a feeling of contentment about meeting deadlines and targets, learning new things, developing creative<br/> ideas that bring improvement, working 
                as part of teams, finding solution to problems and receiving feedback <br/>from users or customers to be able to spot strengths and flaws
                to make sure the end result of a project is as good <br/>as possible.  
            </h5>
            <p>The goal of every business is to be able to satisfy customers. Meeting deadlines with set targets as a company and as an <br/>individual, promotes
                productivity. I am a good example of someone who is ready to learn new technologies, systems and <br/>fields for development. Coming up with creative ideas
                to solve or improve on a problem is something am always happy and <br/>willing to do, especially in teams and whenever there is an opportunity. And
                feedback from people always keep me going. <br/>Both positive and negative feedback allow me to identity what I need to correct, improve on and the 
                best I have achieved.
